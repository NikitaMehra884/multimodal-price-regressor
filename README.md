# multimodal-price-regressor
A multi-modal machine learning project to predict e-commerce prices from text and images. It fuses NLP features (TF-IDF, DistilBERT) with computer vision features (ResNet50). An ensemble of LightGBM and XGBoost models is then trained on the combined feature set to perform the final price regression.
